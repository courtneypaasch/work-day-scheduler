# Work Day Scheduler

The goal of this assignment was to develop a work day scheduler that allows a user to enter data into the form for each hour of the work day. The events persist so that the user can reference back throughout the day and see what they entered. The schedule is also color coded so that past hour blocks are shown in grey, the current hour block is red, and future blocks are green. 

This is important because the functionality of entering data in a specific field and it persisting is commonplace on the web. It was also a good introduction to moment.js which was used to assign and compare times.

Here is a link to the deployed GitHub page:

Here are screenshots of the functioning scheduler:
